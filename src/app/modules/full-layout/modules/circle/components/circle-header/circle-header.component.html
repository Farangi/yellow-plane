					<h1>Welcome to Circles!</h1>
					<p>
						Circles is the place where you can reach out to your community, 
						connect and talk about subjects, host live seminars, have a live in studio 
						concert for your fans, teach a how-to class, have a business meeting. 
						The possibilities are endless and itâ€™s all interactive! Not only can you live 
						comments and questions through the chat but circle participants can have two 
						way open conversations!
					</p>

					<p>
						So, create your first circle, invite people to join it and start sharing your 
						thoughts and ideas
